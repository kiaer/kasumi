\section{TMTO Attack}
As the keysize of an attack on the KASUMI cipher used in the 2G
network is \code{64-bit}, we have to perform our tests on a scaled down
key. With the hardware at our disposal the computation of a table
required to perform the attack on a \code{64-bit} key would simply be
unrealistic. Therefore all of our testing is done on tables generated
with \code{32-bit} keys. We use the same idea as the scaling from \code{128-bit} to
\code{64-bit} discussed in chapter \ref{ch:kas}.

Thus a key $K_{32} = K_1 || K_2$ generated for testing in our \code{32-bit} implementation will
look as follows
\[K = K_1 || K_2 || K_1 || K_2 || K_1 || K_2 || K_1 || K_2\]
As we look to gain an idea of how our implementation matches up with
the math and parameter choices done in chapter \ref{ch:param}, we have to generate
information on an actual attack on a \code{32-bit} key. If our \code{32-bit} test
results match up with our calculations, we can start to give estimates
of how the actual attack on the \code{64-bit} keysize would look.
\subsection{Pre-computational phase}
For testing the table generation we will first set some parameters
which is valid for \code{32-bit} testing.

Using the same parameter setup as described in \ref{sec:rainbowparam}
table \ref{tab:rainparam32} gives us valid parameter choices. For the
testing of \code{32-bit} no boundaries were set.

  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    m & t & M(MB) & T \\ \hline
    $2^{25.00}$ & $2^{7.89}$ & $134.22$ & $2^{13.67}$ \\
    $2^{25.50}$ & $2^{7.39}$ & $189.81$ & $2^{12.71}$ \\
    $2^{26.00}$ & $2^{6.89}$ & $268.44$ & $2^{11.76}$ \\
    $2^{26.50}$ & $2^{6.39}$ & $379.63$ & $2^{10.83}$ \\
    $2^{27.00}$ & $2^{5.89}$ & $536.87$ & $2^{9.92}$ \\
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Since we are only testing on \code{32-bit} there is no real concern of
memory usage or online time. For this reason we went with a parameter
choice of $m=2^{25} \approx 33445532$ and $t= 2^{7.89} \approx
236$. The table generator will be tested on the actual
pre-computational time and the memory usage.

\textbf{Pre-computational time}

From table \ref{tab:rainparam32} it is seen that an expected amount of
KASUMI encryptions required for generation of the table is
$2^{32.886}$. Looking back to \ref{sec:benchkas} we know the
amount of encryptions our test machines can perform in a second. As an
example the previously mentioned Zenbook i7 is used
\[10000000 enc / 1.897 s = 5291005,29 \quad enc/s\]
Now we can easily calculate the expected running time of the
pre-computational phase
