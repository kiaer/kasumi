\section{Distinguished Points Tables}
The distinguished points - tradeof was first described by Rivest in
the book [ref]. It is a simple modification of the Hellman tradeoff
where one does not have chains of the same size, since when a
distinguished point is reached the chain does not continue.

The DP-tradeoff
\subsubsection{Parameters}
There are several parameters that decide the size and the coverage of
the DP-tradeoff like the Hellman tradeoff the table must satisfy the
given matrix stopping rule $mt^2\approx N$ again the difference between
mt and N should not be too large or to close to zero. Again a
matrixstopping constant is used to hold the difference $mt^2\approx
D_{msc}N$. m
