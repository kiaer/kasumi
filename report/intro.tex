\section{KASUMI Cipher and 3G}

In this project, we analyse the real-world security of KASUMI as used
in 2G and 3G networks in form of A5/3 towards time-memory trade-off
attacks. KASUMI is a block cipher algorithm used in mobile embedded
systems to provide security between the phone and the base station. In
the security analysis, the performance optimization of the attack
algorithm will play a major role.

\section{The problem}

\section{Structure of the Thesis}

The thesis is structured such that we will first go through the theory
behind the KASUMI cipher (chapter \ref{ch:kas}) and the different TMTO
attacks (chapter \ref{ch:tmto}). We will then go in depth with the
implementation of both KASUMI and the TMTO route we took(chapter
\ref{ch:impl}). Next we will analyze the results of the attack
(chapter \ref{ch:anal}). Afterwards we will move on to a discussion
about what further improvements could be made (chapter
\ref{ch:disc}). Lastly we will give a conclusion of the project
(chapter \ref{ch:concl}).
