\chapter{Introduction}

In this project, we analyse the real-world security of KASUMI as used in 2G and 3G networks in form of A5/3 towards time-memory trade-off attacks. KASUMI is a block cipher algorithm used in mobile embedded systems to provide security between the phone and the base station. In the security analysis, the performance optimization of the attack algorithm will play a major role.
