\chapter{Parameter and table choice}
\label{ch:param}
For the Time-memory tradeoff attack to viable, the right set of
parameteres and the right table choice is of huge importance. In this
attack we would ideally want to perform the online phase of the  attack on a modern
high-end laptop/desktop machine. For this to be possible, the right
tradeoff between time and memory is needed. For an attack on the
cipher with 64-bit keysize, we know a large table is required. But if
we want to make it possible to perform the attack on a consumer
machine, we need to set an upper bound for the maximal memory
usage. In our attack, we set an upper bound of memory usage to
\code{8TB} of tables. We see this as a possible amount of storage if a
consumer machine with a TMTO-attack in mind was to be build.

Other things to take into consideration when analyzing the parameter
choice, includes
