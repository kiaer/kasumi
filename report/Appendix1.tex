\section{Installation}
\label{sec:inst}
Get the source:

\quad\code{\$ git clone \url{https://github.com/kiaer/kasumi.git}}

Build the TMTO-attack. This will generate the executable
\code{bin/tmto}

\quad\code{\$ make }

The executable \code{tmto} can now be executed with an appropriate
flag:

\quad\code{\$ ./bin/tmto [command]}

The following commands is available to use with \code{tmto}:
\begin{verbatim}
usage: ./bin/tmto [command] 
                -t      Generates 32-bit Rainbow Table 
                -o      Performs online phase on 32-bit Rainbow Table 
                -b      Generates 64-bit Rainbow Table 
                -k      Performs online phase on 64-bit Rainbow Table 
                -h      Prints the very helpful usage message.. 
\end{verbatim}

Generating a table for either the 32-bit or the 64-bit key, the table
is stored in the kasumi root folder as either \code{table32.bin} or
\code{table64.bin}. The onlinephase will perform the attack on its
respective table.

Generation of the cipher, for test purposes is also possible:

\quad\code{\$ make cipher}

An executable \code{bin/kasumi\_test} is created.
